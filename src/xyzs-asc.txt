The XYZ program requires that you first 'home' the robot.
The shoulder should be 6.25 inches from the rear of the
base.  The elbow cam should touch its switch when the elbow
is positioned approximately 10 degrees below horizontal.
The hand must point straight down and the fingers should be
closed and aligned with the base.  The XYZ program requires
as input the co-ordinates in millimeters of the point that
you want to be in the fingertip centre.  For example a
co-ordinate input having an X of 300, a Y of 300, and a Z
of 200 will position the fingertips 300 mm to the left of
the Rhino's centre and 200 mm up from the table.  You can
also specify that the hand is not pointing straight down
by giving the hand rotate prompt some angle other than zero.
If you specify 90 degrees, the hand will be aligned parallel
to the table top.  Specifying 135 degrees will make it point
45 degrees up as if grasping from below.  The point reached
by the fingertips will still be accurate when measured, but
the approach will be from a different angle.  Be careful not
to damage the hand's circuit board.  The fingers will remain
aligned parallel to the base unless you specify some angular
offset.  the fingers can be opened or closed as required.
Move sequences that you create can be stored on disk as with
the joint move program.  You can also edit a move sequence.
