The 'Teach' program consists of four sections: 'create',
'modify', 'save', and 'run'.  Move sequences are created
by typing the number of steps you want each motor to move.
To save a move sequence just entered, exit the 'create'
routine with an 'X' and press '3' to save a move sequence.
To change a move sequence that is saved on disk, read it
into memory with the 'modify' option and then after it's
read in, go back into the 'modify' routine and choose the
option to edit the sequence currently in memory.  Once you
have a move sequence in memory, you may execute it with
the 'run' option.
If you have a printer connected to this computer, you can
get a listing of your move sequence in the 'modify' routine.
Answer 'Y' to the 'send listing to the line printer'
question.
