This program allows you to control all the motors of the
Rhino by giving each a specific number of steps to move.
If you reply to a motor step question with <ENTER> the
program will assign a zero step value to that motor.  The
largest absolute value that can be entered for any motor
for one step is 2000.  Each number you enter is saved into
an array which is passed to the driver when you run the
program after entering the value for the 'A' motor.  To
exit from this routine, as always, use a single 'X' at
one of the motor step inputs.
If you inadvertantly move the joints into an obstacle, the
program will abort the move sequence.
