This program is written to demonstrate the Rhino XR-1 in thefield.  You can get continuous motion from any joint by press-ing the key that activates it and holding it down.  The keysthat operate the individual joints are arranged so that thejoints that have a 'natural' up/down movement such as theshoulder, elbow, or hand have their keys in the keyboard'stopmost row.  The base is operated by the 'R' and 'F' keys.Pressing the 'R' key once moves the base to the 15 steps toyour left.  Similarly pressing 'F' moves the rhino 15 stepsto your right.  The shoulder joint is activated using the'T' and 'G' keys.  Note that the 'T' key is in the topmostrow of keys.  The 'T' key moves the shoulder up.  The 'G'key moves it towards the table top (down).  Next to theshoulder keys are the elbow keys.  They are the 'Y' and'H' keys.  Pressing the 'Y' key gives a 15 step upward move-ment and the 'T' key 15 steps downward.  The hand assemblyis operated using the 'U' and 'J' keys.  The 'U' key beingin the top row if the keyboard moves the hand assembly up,and 'J' gives a complimentary down motion.  The fingers arerotated using the 'I' and 'K' keys.  The 'I' key rotates thefingers in a clockwise manner while the 'K' key is used forcounterclockwise rotation.  The fingers can be opened orclosed using the 'O' or 'L' keys.  the 'L' key closes thefingers while the 'D' key opens them.  All motors aresoftware protected against stall.  The G and H accessorymotors have motion that is device dependent.  Experiment todiscover the movement associated with the 'W'/'S' and 'E'/'D'key pairs with the accessories you have.  To exit always type'X'.
