The 'teach' program consists of five sections: 'create,''modify,' 'save,' 'run,' and 'home.'  Move sequences arecreated similar to the 'move all joints' program.  Aftertyping '3', create a move by typing '1'.  Enter motor stepvalues for the moves you want.  Familiarize yourself withdirections and distance by using the 'move all joints'program prior to the 'teach' progra.  Once the sequence iscreated, you can modify it, save it, or run it.To save a sequence, type a '3'.  You will be asked to givea name for saving the file.  Type in the name and press<ENTER>.  The sequence will be saved.  To edit a movesequence type '2' to enter to 'modify' section.  You canmodify the current sequence, or onr that is on disk.  Ineither case the sequence will be displayed in whole.  Youdo have the option of sending the sequence to a printerconnected to the printer port.  Press <ENTER> afteranswering the question to begin the edit procedure.  Youcan edit any step in the sequence.  The motor name andcurrent move value can be entered, or <ENTER> will retainthe motors present value.  To save the changes, return tothe 'save' section.  A sequence must be in memory to be run.If the sequence is on disk, is must be read in by typing'2' to get into te 'read' section, and then typing '2'again to indicate the file is on disk.  Give the file nameand the file will be loaded.  You will be asked if you wantto send a listing to a printer.  Answering with an <ENTER>will display the move to the screen.  Pressing <ENTER> again,you will be asked which step you want to edit.  Type 'X'<ENTER> then type '4' to run the sequence.  A repeat factorallows you to run the sequence multiple times.  Typing a'5' will send the robot to a hard home position.  The robotwill locate the cams on the bicep, elbow, and waist joints.
